# Team Agreement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

Brilliant Cassowary

## To what goals do we all commit?

-Finish the project on time
-Have a high-quality project

## Weekly meetings

Friday 3:30-4:30 (if we need to stay longer we can)

## Meeting "location"

Olin Library

## Primary method of communication

Discord
(use groupchat if more urgent, such as deadline by the end of the day or if someone doesn't respond after a day)

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

Discord, should notify at latest an hour before the meeting

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

One day before the due date, so we have a day for any fixes or additions

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

Reminders of what the team member promised to do
Check in the groupchat for updates on progress

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

Dairy bar ice cream day once we're done!!

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
